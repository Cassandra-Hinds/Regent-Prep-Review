    <h2>How do you write a Remainder?</h2>
    <p>Before we go into what the Remainder therom is, let's go over how to write an Remainder.</p>
    <p>Let's say the quotient of a long divison of polynomials is: "p^2 + 5p + 6", the divisor is: "p-1", and the Remainder is 10</p>
    <p>You will write the Remainder over/divided by the divisor next/ at the end of the quotient</p>
    <p>in other words it'll look like this...</p>
    <p> p^2 + 5p + 6 <strong>+ 10 / p-1</strong></p>
    <h2>What is ther Remainder therom?</h2>
    <p>It's basically means that and see and the Remainder of a long division problem without actually doing the long division. This also means we get to wither or not the divisor is a factor of the dividen </p>
    <p>Now let's see this in action...</p>
    <h3>Is x-3 a factor of p(x) = x^2 - 11x + 24?</h3>
    <p><strong><em>When a polynomial p(x) is divided by a binomial (x-a), then the remainder will always be p(a)</em></strong></p>
    <p>In english this means you take the opposite sign of the  number in the divisior (so if number is -2, you change it + 2), then youplug in that number any where you see a variable in the eqquation</p>
    <p>After you plug in numbers check to see if the number is zero</p>
     <p>if it is zero the equation has no remainder and is in turn  <strong>a factor.</strong> If it's <strong>not</strong> zero it has a remainder and is <strong><em>not</em> a factor</strong></p>
     <p>Take the problem....</p>
     <p>The number in that divisor is -3 so I'll change it to 3</p>
     <p>Then I plug in 3 where ever I see a variable</p>
     <p>(3)^2 - 11(3) + 24<p>
    <p>Then I'll solve it</p>
     <p>3^2 = 9 </p>
     <p>-11*3 = -33</p>
     <p>9 - 33 = -24</p>
     <p>-24 + 24 = 0</p>
     <p>As you can see I got zero which means x-3 is <strong>a factor</strong></p>
     <h2>Another Example</h2>
     <h3>Is x-4 a factor of x^3 - 7x - 6?</h3>
     <p>The number in that divisor is -4 so I'll change it to 4</p>
     <p>Then I plug in 4 where ever I see a variable</p>
     <p>(4)^3 - 7(4) - 6</p>
      <p>4^3 = 64</p>
      <p>-7 * 4 = -28</p>
      <p>64 - 28 = 36</p>
      <p>36 - 6 = 30</p>
      <p>As you can see I did <strong>not</strong> get zero which means x-4 is <strong><em>not</em> a factor</strong></p>
       <p>side note: the remainder here is thirty and would be written like: 30 / x-4</p>
