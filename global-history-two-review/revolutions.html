    <h1 class="text-center m-5">Revolutions!</h1>
    <p>In History there are hundreds of revolutions; all in important in their own way.</p>
    <p>My goal on this page is to sum them all up and link certain in information to other pages.</p>

    <h2>French Revolution of 1879</h2>
     <p>Prior to the revolution there were three estates. The first Second and Third Estate. The First is made up of the Clergy and it has the smallest poplutation of the three. It also ad the least amount land ownership and paid zero taxes.</p>
     <p>The Second Estate also made no taxes and is made up of the noblitly/aristocrats. It has the second smallest population and landownership.</p>
     <p>The Third Estate make up of middle class/boureoisie(boo-schwa-zee) and peasents and is 98% of the population. They obviously own most land and are the only ones who pay the the goverment tax.</p>
     <p>The unfairness of this wasn't lost on the the third estate and the series of harsh weather leading to harvests in ruins and famine, raised taxes and increased prices on food.</p>
    <p>There women's marches and roits that arose becuase of that.</p>
     <p>King Louis XVI(16) to solve the choas called in the Eastes General</p>
      <p>however the third Estase not liking the fact that they all (98% of the poplutation) have one vote like everyelse so they form the National assembly. And when they got kick out of their building they held meeting in a tenis court and created the tennis court Oath </p>
      <p>Other form of rebellion was Bastille day</p>
      <p>Lastly there was a group called the Jacobins who wanted the complete removal of the king and queen.  One of their leaders was Maximillion Robespierre and used  Dr. Joseph Guillontine's exuctation device  - the guillontine - against anyone who dissagreed woth his cause. As while as had people shot or beaten to death. The main targets was the nobility and aristrocts.<p>
        <p> 40,000 people died in total and the king and queen also died by guillontine</p>
        <p>Maximillion Robespierre was out for the blood and he was so blood thirsty to the point he was getting out of hand. His own commette turned on him and he himself succumbed by the death by guillontine.</p>
      <p>Side note: there were a lot elightment thinker out there during this time as some questioned the divine right of the king and queen</p>
