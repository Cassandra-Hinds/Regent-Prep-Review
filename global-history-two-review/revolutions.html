    <p>In History there are hundreds of revolutions; all in important in their own way.</p>
    <p>My goal on this page is to sum them all up and link certain in information to other pages.</p>

    <h2>French Revolution of 1879</h2>
     <p>Prior to the revolution there were three estates. The first Second and Third Estate. The First is made up of the Clergy and it has the smallest poplutation of the three. It also ad the least amount land ownership and paid zero taxes.</p>
     <p>The Second Estate also made no taxes and is made up of the noblitly/aristocrats. It has the second smallest population and landownership.</p>
     <p>The Third Estate make up of middle class/boureoisie(boo-schwa-zee) and peasents and is 98% of the population. They obviously own most land and are the only ones who pay the the goverment tax.</p>
     <p>The unfairness of this wasn't lost on the the third Estate and the series of harsh weather leading to harvests in ruins and famine, raised taxes and increased prices on food.</p>
