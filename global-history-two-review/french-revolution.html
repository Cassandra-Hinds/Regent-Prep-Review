    <p>Back then people could seperated in the three estates</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The First Esate:Clergy</li>
      <ul>
        <li>0.5% of the population</li>
        <li>0.10% of land ownership</li>
        <li>0% of Government Tax</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Second Esate: Nobility</li>
      <ul><li>1.5% of the population</li>
        <li>25% of land ownership</li>
        <li>0% of Government Tax</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Third Esate:Middle class/Boureoisie(boo-schwa-zee) and Peasents</li>
      <ul>
        <li>98% of the population</li>
        <li>65% of land ownership</li>
        <li>100% of Government Tax</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The irony is that ones who were poorest where the only one's who paid the tax. Rich and the wealthy didn't pay anything; the ones who had money to burn wasn't about about to pay any taxes. So yes, they had the ones that were barely making it in the first place pay them, and pile the taxes on them they did.</p>
    <h2>What inspired the french Revolution?</h2>
    <p>You see France wasn't doing so hot. They were in serve financial ruin and the king - <strong>King XVI(16)</strong> - didn't help at all.</p>
    <p> One way of making the probelm worse was by help funning the <em>American Revolution</em>... and America didn't pay him back. </em>
      <p> As the dept worsen, the third esate was really the only ones who suffered, and elighment thinkers started to question the necessity and the divine right of the king. And all the while, the other estates were spending money like it was going out of style.</p>
      <p>What made it even worse was <strong>King XVI(16)'s</strong> plan to get out of dept...</p>
      <p>You guessed it! Continue taxing the poor and tax them harder!</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qRZcXIODNU?clip=UgkxgULmHw0XYcIhQFT7Ql3sBt6ot3ViikSP&amp;clipt=ENS4FBiq_xc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p> Then natural disasters came uppercutted the third class; leaving their havests in ruin from series of harsh weather</p> 
    <p>This led famine. So grand people had to eat rats instead bread.</p>
    <p>Mothers had to fed their kids vermin because there was nothing else to eat. Was either that or die from starvation. There is no more food or money left for them and the price of bread rose.</p>
    <p>But those women weren't going to stand for that. So they formed this thing called a women's marchs in order to stand up to the government. They took things the their own hands, with rage and sense of of unjustice they raided bakeries.</p>
    <p> With all this choas <strong>King XVI(16)</strong> had to do something. And what he did was call upon <em>The Esates General</em>.</p>
    <h2>The Esates General</h2>
    <p> It was made up of the three Esates and each esate got one vote. The probelm was that usaully the first two estates would usaually agree on something and the third esate would oppose and the third Esate would always get out voted. So any reforms the third esate wanted ended up getting grinded to the dust.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qRZcXIODNU?clip=UgkxBewy8YhZefA3WKd6hzZKUNodRkDf0hMk&amp;clipt=EP2zHxib4SI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p> Obviously the third estate didn't take kind that. Excecially when they're the bulk of the population and suffering the most.</p>
    <p> Not taking it an more they descided to abandon <em>The Esates General</em> and got together and formed they're own government which was called the...
      <h2>The National Assembly</h2>
      <p> There became a problem. </p>
      <p> The third estate was kicked out of their building and was probidden to meet. But the estae wasn't fazed by the that. They just held their meeting a <em>Tennis Court </em>
    <h2>Tennis Court Oath</h2>
       <p>This Oath thereforth born. And they vowed to continue meeting until they recived "equality and economic reform"</p>

    <h2> The Jacobins and The Reign of Terror</h2>
    <p> One of leaders of the <em>Jacobins</em> was <strong>Maximillion Robespierre</strong>
    <p> He was also the leader of public saftey and wanted the removal of the king so they would have no power and for the contry to be run by the commette.</p>
    <p> <em> The Jacbins</em> was must more radical than the rest of the <em>National Assembly.</em> They weren't going to take reforms, and wait around for the possibiltiy that king would give them equality. They were going to take things into their own hands, and their revolutionary strom was violent.</p>
    <p> The people of france's patients with king was going extremly thin</em>
    <h2>Bastile Day(July 14th 1789)</h2>
    <p> One way of doing this was storming and raiding a millitary hospital for weapons and armary. 
   <p> However with guns you need gun powder and the powder they needed was in a prison fortress called the <em> Bastile</em>. During this time they also unleashed harden criminals on the streets.</p>

  <h2> A famous Women's March</h2>
  <p> The idea soon came that the compliancy of the king came because he lived away from the crisis in Versaille - meaning he was living in comfort, when  he's subjects were suffering in Paris</p>
  <p> For their remedy a much of women went and march the city of Versaille. At this <strong>King XVI(16)</strong> could not ignore the problem anymore, so he agreed to sign the <em> Declaration of the Rights of Men</em> However when it came to coming back with them(the women) to Paris, the king hesitiation. The lack of complinace ignited rage with the women and they stromed the place; seeking for the blood of <strong>Queen Marie Antionette</strong>. When some were searching for the queen, others massacred guards and stick their heads on pikes.</p>

  <p>With no other choice the king agreed to back to Pairs with them</p>

  <h2> The Radical Jacbins</h2>
  <p>There came a time were the king was thought to be a traitor for trying to leave Paris. <strong>King XVI(16)'s</strong> position was reduce but the Jacobins weren't happy that the king wasn't fully removed. There became two sides in the Revolution: the <em> Moderates</em> - the people wanted the royals in power - and the <em>radicals</em> - people who wanted the exact opposite(wanted them died). And it was the <em>radicals</em> who was gaining the support of the people.</p> 
  <p> With help of a man named <strong>Dr. Joseph Guillontine's</strong> exuctation device  - the guillontine - <strong>Maximillion Robespierre</strong> used it to against anyone who dissagreed woth his cause. As while as had people shot or beaten to death. The main targets was the nobility and aristrocts.<p>
  <p> 40,000 people died in total and the king and queen also died by guillontine</p>
  <p><strong>Maximillion Robespierre</strong> was out for the blood and he was so blood thirsty to the point he was getting out of hand. His own commette turned on him and he himself succumbed by the death by guillontine.</p>
